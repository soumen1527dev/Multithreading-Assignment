    "# Advantage of Multithreading :\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows applications to remain responsive to user interactions or\n",
    "# external events while performing background tasks. For example, in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), it \n",
    "# prevents the interface from freezing during time-consuming operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Parallelism: Multithreading can lead to improved performance in applications with tasks that can be divided \n",
    "# into smaller subtasks that can run concurrently. This is especially beneficial for I/O-bound operations where \n",
    "# threads can overlap waiting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, making it easier to share data and \n",
    "# resources among them without the need for complex inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Simplicity: In some cases, multithreading can simplify the design and implementation of concurrent systems\n",
    "#  compared to using multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Lower Overhead: Threads have lower overhead in terms of memory and resource consumption compared to separate \n",
    "# processes because they share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages of multithreading :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts the execution of Python bytecode\n",
    "# to one thread at a time in CPython (the default Python interpreter). This limitation can hinder the performance of CPU\n",
    "# bound tasks in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Complexity: Managing and synchronizing threads can introduce complexities such as potential race conditions,\n",
    "# eadlocks, and thread safety issues. Debugging multithreaded code can be more challenging than single-threaded code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Increased Complexity of Testing: Testing multithreaded code can be more challenging due to the nondeterministic\n",
    "# nature of thread scheduling. This can make it difficult to reproduce and diagnose threading-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Platform Dependence: Multithreading behavior can vary across different operating systems and platforms.\n",
    "# Code that works correctly on one platform may not behave the same way on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Limited Scalability: As the number of threads increases, the overhead associated with thread management\n",
    "# and synchronization can outweigh the benefits of parallelism, leading to diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Potential for Resource Contention: When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, they can contend \n",
